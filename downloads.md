ND4j has a number of backends used for computations (GPUs, different native
blas bindings) . In Maven it's fairly easy to switch between different backends. 

This may not be as easy without. Here we provide a number of archives that contain all of the jar files 
required for usage of different of nd4j backends.

Currently ND4j has 3 different versions. 2 native and 1 for GPUs.

# Downloads

ND4j allows you to alternate between the computational backends (GPUs and different native blas bindings). In Maven, it's fairly easy to switch between different backends. 

This may not be as easy without. Here we provide a number of archives that contain all of the jar files required for usage of different of ND4J backends.

Currently ND4j has three different versions: Two for native and one for GPUs.

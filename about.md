ND4J is an open-source, distributed deep-learning project in Java spearheaded by the people at [Skymind](http://www.skymind.io/contact.html), a San Francisco-based business intelligence and enterprise software firm. We're a team of data scientists, deep-learning specialists, Java programmers and semi-sentient robots.

Scientific computing helps analysts mine big data for value. We think industry has only begun to understand and monetize its data, which is why we chose to implement scientific computing for the JVM. 

ND4J is distributed under an Apache 2.0 License.

## Jobs @Skymind

We hire from our open-source contributors. The best way to apply for a job building the future of deep learning with us is to join our community on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j), fork us on [Github](https://github.com/deeplearning4j), find a problem to work on with us, and we'll can see if there's a fit! Working together is more informative than interviews, and with a little luck it's be more fun.
